🚀 Exciting Project Alert! 🚀

I'm thrilled to share my latest project, an Text Generator and Sentiment Analysis powered by the incredible Gemini Pro Vision model and Hugging Face! 🌟✨

🔍 Key Features:

Text response on your question.
Analysis wheather response is positive, negetive, or neutral.
Dynamic content generation based on text input.
💡 How It Works: The project leverages the Gemini Pro Vision model and Hugging Face to process text. Users can provide input. The result? Engaging and informative content generated and analysis in real-time!


🌐 Tech Stack:

Python
Hugging Face
Google Generative AI API


❇️Gemini can perform advanced coding tasks, such as:

Translating code between languages
Generating different coding solutions for the same problem
Gemini Pro runs off-device, in Google’s data centers, and can be accessed through the Gemini API. Google says the easiest way to use Gemini is with Google AI Studio, a web-based tool that enables prototyping and running prompts in a browser

🤗The pipelines are a great and easy way to use models for inference. These pipelines are objects that abstract most of the complex code from the library, offering a simple API dedicated to several tasks, including Named Entity Recognition, Masked Language Modeling, Sentiment Analysis, Feature Extraction and Question Answering.
